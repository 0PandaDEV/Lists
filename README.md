# Details:
These lists were created because the founder of the project wanted something with a little more control over what is being blocked. Many lists are all or nothing. We set out to create lists with more control over what is being blocked.


&nbsp;

# Usage:
These converted files can be used with various DNS and domain-blocking tools:

## Using with [Pi-Hole](https://pi-hole.net/):

1. Copy the link to the Pi-Hole format for the desired list (from the appropriate table below).
2. Add the URL to your Pi-Hole's block lists (**Login** > **Group Management** > **Adlists** > **Paste list URL in "Address" field, add comment** > **Click "Add"**)
3. Update Gravity (**Tools** > **Update Gravity** > **Click "Update"** )


<sup>Instructions current as of Pi-Hole 5.1
*Not supported by or affiliated with Pi-Hole.</sup>

## Using with other tools:
We are currently working on verifying compatibility with other tools. Please stand by. If you have a suggestion on a tool we should support please comment on our [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/blocklistproject/) page.
