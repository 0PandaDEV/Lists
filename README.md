# Details:
These lists were created because the founder of the project wanted something with a little more control over what is being blocked. Many lists are all or nothing. We set out to create lists with more control over what is being blocked.


&nbsp;

# Usage:
These converted files can be used with various DNS and domain-blocking tools:
